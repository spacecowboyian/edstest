EDS Code Project
================

Hi!

This code project is a single small exercise. Its purpose is to illustrate basic technical skill and provide context for the final interview.

Instructions
------------

Your task is to create a functional prototype of the attached mocks. Please note the following:

  1. You can use any technology stack you want but must use the Experian Design System modules (and you'll need to install them via npm *locally*):
    - eds-styles
    - eds-elements
  2. The mocks are intentionally incomplete and meant to generate discussion. We are interested in your output and the rationale behind any decisions you make with incomplete data.
  3. The auto-complete component does not exist, you'll need to create it as a custom HTML element. There are examples of custom HTML elements in the "eds-elements" module. This is not a deep test of coding skill and there will not be an extensive review. Rather, this is a simple exercise to illustrate you can build components.

Completion
----------

This exercise should not require significant investment of your time. Again, the purpose is to illustrate basic skills and provite context for the final interview.  When you're done, please email a link to the project to eds@experian.com.

We look forward to reviewing your project with you in the final interview!
